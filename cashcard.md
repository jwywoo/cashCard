Spring Boot : Introduction to RESTful web service

Building an web app that handles allowance of user's kids
1. Creating a single cash card in a DB
2. Allowing user to editing, deleting and viewing of multiple cash cards
3. Deploying and monitoring the app in the cloud

Further more, there will be explanations about RESTful API including benefits and tradeoffs

Spring's Inversion of Control Container
Also know as IoC(Inversion of Control) Container or DI(dependency injection)

Spring allows you to configure how and when dependencies are use or 'injected' into the app at runtime

Spring Initializer
url: `start.spring.io`

JSON & Data Contracts
JSON -> Javascript Object Notation
Providing a data interchange format that represents particular information of  object -> easy to use and understand

YAML & XML
Compare to YAML, JSON is easy to user and takes less space.
Further more, JSON works well with Javascript based application

JSON Contract
It is a formal agreement between a service & client to communicates the data to be exchnaged
This characteristics allows server and client to use different language but have to have same contracts
This is important since it defines behavior of a REST API and provides specific details of serialized (or deserialized) for each commands and parameter being exchanged.
Also, it is understandable for both developer and REST API.
